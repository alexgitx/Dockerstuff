# Dockerstuff
I found a script by Théo Chamley, that basically did exactly what I was looking for. I took the liberty of making a few modifications to meet my specific needs.

Disk space was an issues so I am storing image archives on an NAS instead of locally
I may want to save my images archives
and since I planned to share this code, I added some instructions and options to exit before the process started.
With this script in hand, all you need to do is identify the docker image IDs (docker images) then enter them as arguments separated by spaces for the scripts.
